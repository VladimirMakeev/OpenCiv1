## Repository description
<p>This a direct reimplementation of Civilization 1 game designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley in year 1991.</p>
<p>The game is still a very popular and easy to play. But the obsoletness of DOS or Windows 3.1 16-bit platform and the bugs that have never been fixed
are hindering the popularity of the game<p>

## Status
<p>The game is playable in current state, but requires Original game v475.05 to be present in 'c:\dos\civ' directory. The civ.exe needs to be in the unpacked state, see https://github.com/rajko-horvat/CivUnpack</p>

## Running the code
If you want to run the code, it is assumed that:
<ul>
<li>You are using VS2022 community version (don't know if this is important).</li>
<li>You have fully functional, unpacked and installed CIV I game at 'c:\dos\civ\' (latest unpacked exe version 475.05 required, see my CIV EXE unpacker: https://github.com/rajko-horvat/CivUnpack).
It's where it's home directory resides (Images, palettes, overlays and save games are loaded/saved there, for now).</li>
</ul>

## Help needed
<p>All contributions are welcome.</p>
For this stage of code reconstruction, the programmings skills needed are:
<ul>
<li>Moderate knowledge of assembly language,</li>
<li>Knowledge of C# language.</li>
<li>For details see: https://github.com/rajko-horvat/OpenCiv1/wiki/Introduction-to-code-translating</li>
</ul>

## Final Goal for this project
<p>Is a reconstruction of the full functionality, fixing the bugs and porting it to modern platforms so everyone can play</p>
The planned milestones to reach:
<ul>
<li>Reaching the initial playability of the game (passed),</li>
<li>Reconstruction of the original functionalities and features (still in progress),</li>
<li>Fixing the bugs and intruduction of new features (multiplayer capabilities...),</li>
<li>Porting to HTML5 platform,</li>
<li>Redesigning graphics and music.</li>
</ul>
