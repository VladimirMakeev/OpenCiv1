## Repository description
<p>This is a direct rewrite of Civilization game designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley in year 1991.</p>
<p>The game is still very popular and easy to play. But the obsoletness of DOS or Windows 16-bit platform and the bugs that have never been fixed
are hindering the popularity of the game.<p>

## Current status
<p>The game is playable in current state, but requires Original game v475.05 to be present.</p>

## Running the code
If you want to run the code, it is assumed that:
<ul>
<li>You are using VS2022 community version (don't know if this is important).</li>
<li>You have fully functional, unpacked and installed CIV I game at 'c:\dos\civ\' (latest unpacked exe version 475.05 required, see my CIV EXE unpacker: https://github.com/rajko-horvat/CivUnpack).
It's where it's home directory resides (Images, palettes, overlays and save games are loaded/saved there, for now).</li>
</ul>

## Help needed
<p>All contributions are welcome.</p>
For this stage of code rewrite, the programmings skills needed are:
<ul>
<li>Moderate knowledge of assembly language,</li>
<li>Knowledge of C# language.</li>
<li>For details see: https://github.com/rajko-horvat/OpenCiv1/wiki/Introduction-to-code-translating</li>
</ul>

## Project milestones
<p>The goal is to completely rewrite the code (first stage), fix the bugs and port the code to a modern platform (second stage).</p>
<b>Milestones for a first stage are:</b>
<ul>
<li>Reaching the initial playability of the game (passed),</li>
<li>Rewrite of the original code, functionalities and features (in progress...),</li>
<li>Archive the original code.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Planned milestones for a second stage are:</b>
