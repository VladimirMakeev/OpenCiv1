## Repository description
<p>This a direct reimplementation of Civilization 1 game designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley in year 1991.</p>
<p>The game is still a very popular and easy to play. But the obsoletness of DOS or Windows 3.1 16-bit platform and the bugs that have never been fixed
are hindering the popularity of the game<p>

If you want to run the code, it is assumed that:
<ul>
<li>You are using VS2022 community version (don't know if this is important).</li>
<li>You have fully functional, unpacked and installed CIV I game at 'c:\dos\civ\' (latest unpacked exe version 475.05 required, see my CIV EXE unpacker: https://github.com/rajko-horvat/CivUnpack).
It's where it's home directory resides (Images, palettes, overlays and save games are loaded/saved there, for now).</li>
</ul>

## Screenshots of the game
